# ShiftCipher - v1.0
A shift-cipher encryption and decryption method for JavaScript and Python.
<h2>What is it?</h2>
ShiftCipher enables you to encrypt and decrypt both Strings and Objects (JS) / Dictionaries (PY)
Ideal to keep prying eyes off of your information, this is not suitable for sensitive info.
Great for basic data transfer between client and server-side. (Hence the rewrite in Python too.)

<b>Note:</b> This encryptor is not suitable for sensitive information! This is only a simple layer of obfuscation that can be easily reversed engineered with some patience and motive.</b>
